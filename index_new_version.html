    <!-- Overall Introduction -->
    <section id="intro">
      <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>
      <p>The New York City subway system is one of the largest public transit networks in the world. Before COVID-19, nearly 5 million people took the subway every day. But something dramatic happened during the pandemic that changed everything about how New Yorkers travel.</p>
      
      <p>Understanding these changes is important for several reasons. First, it shows us how work habits have changed, especially with more people working from home. Second, it helps us see how factors like weather and air quality now affect people's travel choices. Finally, these patterns can guide city planning and transportation policy for the future.</p>
      
      <p>This project examines a critical question: where did the missing million subway riders go? Between 2020 and 2024, about 1 million daily riders disappeared from the system. Some bought cars, some started working from home permanently, and some left New York entirely. By looking at ridership data together with weather information and geographic patterns, we can understand this new reality of urban transportation.</p>
      
      <p>Our analysis uses data from the MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) combined with weather records and maps of the subway network. We track how different transportation modes recovered from the pandemic and explore what factors now influence people's decisions to take the subway.</p>
      
      <p>To learn more about NYC transit and urban transportation, you can visit the <a href="http://www.mta.info/" target="_blank">MTA official website</a> or check reports from <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/home/home.shtml" target="_blank">NYC Department of Transportation</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Introduction to the Data -->
    <section id="data">
      <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>
      <p>Our analysis uses three main datasets that work together to tell the complete story of how NYC subway ridership changed during and after the pandemic.</p>
      
      <h3>Ridership Data</h3>
      <p>The first dataset comes from the MTA and contains daily ridership numbers from March 2020 to October 2024. This gives us over 1,600 days of data covering three types of transportation:</p>
      
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Variable Name</th>
            <th>Details</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Date</td>
            <td>Daily records from March 2020 to October 2024</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Subways</td>
            <td>Number of people taking the subway each day</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Buses</td>
            <td>Number of people taking buses each day</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Bridges & Tunnels</td>
            <td>Number of vehicles using bridges and tunnels each day</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Subways_pct</td>
            <td>Subway ridership compared to pre-pandemic levels (percentage)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Buses_pct</td>
            <td>Bus ridership compared to pre-pandemic levels (percentage)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Bridges_Tunnels_pct</td>
            <td>Bridge/tunnel traffic compared to pre-pandemic levels (percentage)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      
      <p>This data shows us not just how subway ridership changed, but also how other ways of traveling changed. This helps us understand where subway riders went.</p>
      
      <h3>Weather Data</h3>
      <p>We added weather information to understand how rain, snow, and air quality affect people's choice to take the subway:</p>
      
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Variable Name</th>
            <th>Details</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>precipitation</td>
            <td>Amount of rain or snow each day (in inches)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>weather_condition</td>
            <td>Type of weather (Sunny, Light Rain, Moderate Rain, Heavy Rain, Snow)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>AQI</td>
            <td>Air Quality Index (0-500, where lower is better)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>day_of_week</td>
            <td>Monday through Sunday</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>period</td>
            <td>Which phase of the pandemic (Pre-COVID, During COVID, Recovery, Post-COVID)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      
      <p>By combining ridership with weather, we can see if people's behavior changed. For example, did weather matter more after the pandemic than before?</p>
      
      <h3>Geographic Data</h3>
      <p>To understand the subway network's structure, we used station location data from <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/" target="_blank">NYC Open Data</a>. This geographic information helps us understand why different parts of the subway system recovered differently.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Visualization 1: Transit Usage Over Time -->
    <section id="viz1">
      <h2>Three Different Recovery Stories</h2>
      <p>In March 2020, when the pandemic hit New York, all types of transportation collapsed at the same time. Subway ridership fell by 96%, dropping from about 5 million daily trips to just 200,000. What happened afterward reveals how New Yorkers' travel habits changed for good.</p>
      
      <p>This first visualization tracks three lines: subways (red), buses (orange), and private vehicles using bridges and tunnels (blue). Private vehicles recovered fastest. By summer 2020, bridge and tunnel traffic was already back to 80–90% of normal, and by 2021 it exceeded pre-pandemic levels. People who could afford cars bought them, and many suburban commuters who once took the train chose to drive instead because it felt safer and more flexible.</p>
      
      <p>Buses returned more slowly, reaching about 60–70% of their original ridership. They are still public transit, but the presence of windows and fresh air made them feel safer than underground subway cars during the pandemic.</p>
      
      <p>Subways recovered the least. Even by 2024, subway ridership only reached about 60–80% of pre-pandemic levels, meaning roughly one million daily riders never came back. The gap between the rising blue line for cars and the much lower red line for subways suggests permanent lifestyle changes: some people moved away, some shifted to full-time remote work, and others became long-term drivers.</p>

      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Visualization 2: Weather Density -->
    <section id="viz2">
      <h2>How Weather Started to Matter</h2>
      <p>Before the pandemic, weather didn't affect subway ridership much. Rain or shine, people had to go to work, so they took the subway regardless. But something changed after the pandemic, and this visualization shows exactly what.</p>
      
      <p>We created violin plots to show the distribution of daily ridership across four time periods: before COVID, during COVID, the recovery phase, and post-pandemic. Each violin's width shows how common different ridership levels were, and the colors show different weather conditions.</p>
      
      <p>What this visualization really shows is freedom. Before the pandemic, people had no freedom—work required being in the office. Now, many people can choose whether to go in based on weather, how they feel, or what day of the week it is. The subway went from being a necessity to being one option among many.</p>

        <iframe class="chart-frame tall" src="charts/weather_density.html" title="Weather Density Across Pandemic Phases"></iframe>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Visualization 3: AQI vs Ridership -->
    <section id="viz3">
      <h2>Does Air Quality Affect Subway Ridership?</h2>
      <p>New York's air quality changes throughout the year. Summer brings heat and smog. Winter brings pollution from heating systems. Sometimes wildfire smoke from Canada drifts over the city (like the orange sky in summer 2023). This visualization lets you filter the data to see only days when air quality was acceptable (AQI below 120). The scatter plot shows each day as a dot, colored by which pandemic period it belongs to. You can use the slider to adjust the air quality threshold and see how the pattern changes. This is actually a surprising finding. You might think that after the pandemic made people more health-conscious, they would care more about air quality. But the data shows the opposite. By 2024, air quality barely affects ridership. The real question people ask isn't "Is the air clean today?" but rather "Do I have to go to the office today?"</p>

        <iframe class="chart-frame tall" src="charts/aqi_periods_v2.html" title="AQI vs Ridership Pandemic Timeline"></iframe>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Visualization 4: Heatmap -->
    <section id="viz4">
      <h2>The New Weekly Pattern</h2>
      <p>Now that we understand how weather and air quality affect ridership, let's look at when people actually take the subway. This heatmap shows average ridership for each day of the week combined with different precipitation levels. The darker the blue color, the higher the ridership.</p>
      
      <p>This pattern reveals something important about the post-pandemic work world. The subway is no longer a necessity people use regardless of conditions. It's one transportation option among many. People make their choice based on the day of the week, the weather, and their work requirements. The flexibility to make these choices is something most workers didn't have before 2020.</p>

    </section>

    <!-- Visualization 5: Map -->
    <section id="viz5">
      <h2>Understanding the Subway Network</h2>
      <p>To make sense of all these patterns, we need to see how ridership changed across different parts of the city. This map comparison shows NYC subway stations in 2023 (left) and 2020 (right), with orange dots representing each station. The size of each dot shows the ridership level at that station—larger dots mean more riders.</p>
      
      <p>Looking at the 2020 map (right), we see much smaller orange dots across the entire system. This was during the pandemic when ridership collapsed. The dots are tiny and fairly uniform in size, showing that ridership was low everywhere.</p>
      
      <p>The 2023 map (left) tells a different story. The dots have grown larger, but not evenly. Notice how the orange dots in Manhattan's core (the dense center area) are noticeably larger. Stations in Midtown, the Financial District, and along major north-south corridors show bigger dots, indicating stronger ridership recovery. This makes sense—these areas contain offices, businesses, and services that require in-person presence.</p>
      
      <p>The size difference between dots reveals the geographic inequality of recovery. Central Manhattan stations recovered ridership faster and stronger (larger dots), while suburban and residential stations show weaker recovery (smaller dots). You can see this pattern radiating outward—the farther from Manhattan's core, the smaller the dots tend to be.</p>

    <!-- Summary -->
    <section id="summary">
      <h2>Summary and Future Work</h2>
      <p>Our analysis reveals that the pandemic permanently transformed NYC's transportation system. While private vehicles fully recovered and exceeded pre-pandemic levels, subways remain at only 60-80% recovery, with about 1 million daily riders lost to remote work, car ownership, or relocation. Weather and day of week now significantly affect ridership decisions—particularly the Tuesday-Thursday core office days and the surprising boost from light rain. However, air quality matters less than expected, with work schedules dominating commute decisions. Geographic patterns explain the uneven recovery: Manhattan's core business district lines recovered faster than residential commuter lines to outer boroughs. The subway has evolved from a daily necessity to one transportation choice among many. Future research could explore station-level patterns, incorporate data on alternative transportation modes like cycling and ride-sharing, and investigate demographic factors behind ridership loss. The MTA should adapt to this new reality by optimizing service for Tuesday-Thursday peaks, maintaining quality over capacity, and recognizing that flexibility in work arrangements has permanently reshaped urban commuting patterns.</p>
